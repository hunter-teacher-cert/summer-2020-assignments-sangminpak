 public class PhoneBook{
 /*
 add();
 add() should take in the person's full name as well as their phone number.
 I want something to look like:
 add(lastName, firstName, phoneNumber)
 Inside the method, I want it to look like:
 
 int[] lastNameArray;
 lastNameArray[lastName.charAt(0)], which means like you're basically going to
 A section or F section in that phone book,
 and then it stores that person's full last name, the first name and phone #.
 But can a node store multiple things?
 maybe if we do something like Node(String lastName, String firstName, String phoneNumber).....
 and then something like this.lastName = lastName; this.firstName = firstName; this.phoneNumber=phoneNumber;
 
 
 
 
 find();
 if we are ONLY using the names to find the person,
 first it should look at lastName.charAt(0);
 that should tell the program which index to look.
 Then, it can go down the linked list to find if the values inside the nodes are equal..
 So some kind of for loop here... or while loop..?
 
 remove();
 basically use LList remove() to have the node skip one and connect to the next
 
 printList();
 while traversing the array, it would go down the linked list and print the values stored in
 the variables in the order.
